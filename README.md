# GUI-Concurrent-Data-Analyzer

This Java project performs GUI-based data analysis through a multi-threaded approach.

- Pulls data files ("blocks") from a server
- Runs analysis on those data blocks using either a Naive or Optimized analysis algorithm
- Outputs results to a user-defined directory

-- User has the option of defining how many threads (up to 5) will be utilized in performing analysis
-- User may choose which algorithm to use for analysis
-- Log provides real-time incremental updates on progress
